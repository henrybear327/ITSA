# Notes for Contest 40

1. Compare function: Don't do ```return a - b``` if a and b are floating point numbers!! (problem B)
2. Don't use copy paste unless the code is identical! Messed up problem D with this
stupid mistake.

# Common pitfalls

* Think of `long long int` before coding.
* use `scanf("%s", input)` when there is no spaces in the string. Mix usage of `fgets` and `scanf` will have `\n` problem
* UVa 11988: when using global variables, don't forget to INITIALIZE it before starting reading in new test cases!!
